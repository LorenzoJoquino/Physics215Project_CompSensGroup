We test how well the original signal can be recovered with varying number of random sample points, p_sub.
We also sampled uniformly-spaced points for comparison. It was kept at p_reg = 1260 because that is the
Nyquist frequency, which is double the highest signal frequency. For each p_sub, we first reconstructed
signal with a frequency of 30 Hz. Then, we reconstructed signal with an added sine wave with frequency
60Hz. We kept adding more sine waves with frequencies shown in freq to the signal and reconstructed them.
The power spectral density (PSD) of the original signal, reconstructed signal with uniformly-spaced
points, and the reconstructed signal with random points were acquired. The errors of the reconstructed
signals with respect to the PSD of the original signal were computed and compared to each other.

Parameters:
Number of points of the original signal, n = 4096
Number of uniformly-spaced sample points, p_reg = 1260
Number of random sample points, p_sub = [8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048]
Frequencies of signal, freq = [30, 90, 150, 210, 270, 330, 390, 450, 510, 570, 630]

Reconstruction Method = CoSaMP

We evaluated how well the original signal can be reconstructed using varying numbers of randomly sampled points,
denoted as p_sub. For comparison, we also reconstructed the signal using uniformly spaced samples at a fixed
count of p_reg = 1260, which corresponds to the Nyquist rateâ€”twice the highest frequency component in the signal.
For each value of p_sub, we first tested reconstruction using a 30 Hz sine wave. Additional sine waves with
frequencies listed in the array freq (e.g., 60 Hz, etc.) were incrementally added to the signal. The signal was
reconstructed at each step. We then computed the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the original signal, the signal
reconstructed using uniformly spaced samples, and the one reconstructed using random sampling. Finally, we
calculated and compared the reconstruction errors of both methods with respect to the PSD of the original signal.

Parameters:
Number of points of the original signal, n = 4096
Number of uniformly-spaced sample points, p_reg = 1260
Number of random sample points, p_sub = [8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048]
Frequencies of signal, freq = [30, 90, 150, 210, 270, 330, 390, 450, 510, 570, 630]
